Create the virtual environment
To create a virtual environment, you must specify a path. For example to create one in the local directory called ‘mypython’, type the following:

virtualenv mypython
Activate the virtual environment
You can activate the python environment by running the following command:

Mac OS / Linux
source mypython/bin/activate
Windows
mypthon\Scripts\activate
You should see the name of your virtual environment in brackets on your terminal line e.g. (mypython).

Any python commands you use will now work with your virtual environment

Deactivate the virtual environment
To decativate the virtual environment and use your original Python environment, simply type ‘deactivate’.

deactivate
